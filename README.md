AngularJS Pokemon flashcards

Our first experiement with Angular. 

The game presently works locally in Safari only...because of this: 
```
XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://pokeapi.co/api/v1/pokemon/20/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://katherineimogene.com' is therefore not allowed access.
```
